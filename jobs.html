                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>A Software Engineer is generally known for creating, developing and testing new or existing software solutions. They create software different programming languages in order to provide new applications or make changes to existing ones. The work requires a lot of skill, patience and involves rigorous testing to ensure that software runs effectively and is free from errors. Software engineers also employ the services of computer programmers in order to create the code as this can save time and can also make the process easier. Generally, software engineers will have specific degrees and experience which will allow them to provide the most effective software solutions to the industries.</p>
                    <p>A web developer on the other hand is used to create websites or to improving existing websites. This is done through using programming codes such as HTML5 and Javascript. Web developers generally have a range of skills which enables them create effective websites for businesses which function correctly, but also increase sales or ‘hits’. Web developers stay with the development of a website from the moment the design is handed over to the final stages when the code is validated. A web developer doesn’t only develop a website but they also manage content and debug any issues. A web developer will not only be able to provide an updated website for businesses but also provide a comprehensive service post development to maintain the current look and feel of the design.</p>
                    <p>A computer programmer generally has multiple languages under their belt and can use these to perform a number of computer related tasks including the creation of programmes and applications. It’s often that computer programmers will work with software engineers.Computer programmers will be skilled in using coding languages such as C++, Java and others. They will also be logical and analytical which enables them to solve problems and create useful pieces of code which tell the software or computer what to do. Computer programmers might not have the same skills as a web developer, but may be involved in the process of building websites whether that be creating small scripts or creating entire products.</p>
                    <p>Generally, all three roles integrate together. As stated above a software engineer could utilise the skills of both a web developer and a programmer but individually all three roles are respected in their own way and are in fact very different.</p>
